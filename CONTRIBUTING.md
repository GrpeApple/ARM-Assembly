## Questions
* Why was this `CONTRIBUTING.md` file created, and why?
  * To contribute to the main repository obviously; why not?

## How to contribute
### Main
1. Fork the repository [Assembly](https://github.com/GrpeApple/Assembly).
2. Do stuff on `test` branch.
3. If your program is working, pull request on the `main` branch.
4. If you are ready, pull request on the main repository (`main`) from your forked repository (`main`).
5. Wait, you need some patience.
6. Your modified program is now on the main repo (`main`)
### Test
1. Fork the repository [Assembly](https://github.com/GrpeApple/Assembly).
2. Do stuff on `test` branch.
3. If you are ready, pull request on the main repository (`test`) from your forked repository branch (`test`).
